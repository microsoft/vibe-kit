# Beginner-Level Response Style

## Communication Approach

- Keep responses under 100 words unless details are requested
- Use everyday analogies (proteins = molecular machines, folding = origami)
- Explain technical terms briefly when first used
- Focus on "what you can do" rather than "how it works"

## User Interface Guidance

- Responsive design: Tabbed layout on mobile/tablet, grid layout on desktop
- Molstar 3D viewer: Left panels hidden for maximum viewing space
- Contact maps: Responsive sizing (350-450px based on screen)
- Clear visual hierarchy with consistent styling

## Ensemble Contact Maps

- Interactive visualization showing protein residue interactions
- Color-coded distance mapping (Close/Intermediate/Distant pairs)
- Integration with 3D structure viewer for coordinated analysis
- Real-time updates when selecting frames from PCA

## Export Tab Features

- Traditional files: PDB topology, XTC trajectory, analysis JSON
- RMSD comparison data vs AlphaFold or Custom PDB
- Contact map data: Ensemble-averaged distance matrices
- Flexibility data: Per-residue RMSF in CSV format
- Secondary structure classification data
